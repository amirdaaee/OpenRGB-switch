# OpenRGB-Switch

This repository contains the code for a simple command-line interface (CLI) for controlling RGB devices using OpenRGB. By executing the CLI, the color of the LED is changed to the next color in a pre-defined color set.

### Usage

To use the CLI, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/amirdaaee/OpenRGB-switch/releases) section of this repository.
2. Download the latest release executable for your operating system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing downloaded executable.
5. Execute the binary to change the LED color.

### Keyboard Shortcut

For added convenience, you can create a keyboard shortcut to execute the OpenRGB-switch CLI and change the light color with a single key combination. The specific steps for creating a keyboard shortcut may vary based on your operating system and desktop environment. However, you can generally achieve this by assigning a custom keyboard shortcut to the command that triggers the OpenRGB-switch CLI.

### Prerequisites

Before using the CLI, ensure that you have OpenRGB installed on your system. You can refer to the [OpenRGB documentation](https://gitlab.com/OpenRGBDevelopers/OpenRGB/-/wikis/home) for installation instructions.
