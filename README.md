1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/amirdaaee/OpenRGB-switch/releases) section of this repository.
2. Download the latest release executable for your operating system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing downloaded executable.
5. Execute the binary to change the LED color.

### Prerequisites
